Rather, the vividness of these, juxtaposed with the early childhood innocence, created a magical feeling. This compelled me to rate this as nothing less than a classic.<br/><br/>The suspense between hope and broken promises, the clash between Scout's innocence and Ewell's unscrupulousness pushes the plot forward - there was barely a boring moment - all without invoking the adrenaline induced excitement.<br/><br/>Recommended to anyone, of any taste and any age.",,5.9 hrs<br/>283 wpm,1,,,0,,,,,

A girl who kills people at night fascinates about ball gowns and men (who can ""support"" her) is certainly an overkill, and thus an eyesore. It could have been more than that, adding a little character integrity besides her overwhelming ""killing machine"" aura (which was well-executed, I have to admit) couldn't hurt.<br/><br/>What did I expect, though - this seemed like a teenage fantasy after all.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
